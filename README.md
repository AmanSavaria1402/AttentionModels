# AttentionModels

This project was part of the assignment of the [Applied AI Course](https://www.appliedaicourse.com/) certification course that I did during my 3rd year of undergraduate, in 2020-2021. The goal of this project was to understand the sequence to sequence models and attention models using a hands on approach following [this](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/understand-sequence-to-sequence-models-in-a-more-intuitive-way-1d517d8795bb) blog by implementing a language translation model from Italian to English. The base notebook containing the grader functions and function/class outlines with the reference blog was provided as part of the course material, and I, the student was expected to write the code in these functions and classes to implement sequence to sequence and attention models using numpy and tensorflow/keras low level functions.<br>

This assignment was reviewed, evaluated and approved by a mentor assigned by the course.
